IMage Update Notifier

This thing does what it says on the tin, takes an OCI image and tag and notifies if there is an updated version

Stuff it should do:
	* Notify via a number of different ways (Webhook, email, script)
	* Accept configuration in a number of ways (configuration file, env variables)
	* Not assume where it will be run (local on a server, docker, web functions, etc)
	
It does none of this as of now.
